## Important Notes

⚠️ **These are NOT real Crystal Reports files** - they are text-based mock files for testing purposes.

Real .rpt files are:
- Binary files created by Crystal Reports Designer
- Contain proprietary data structures
- Typically 1-50+ MB in size
- Require Crystal Reports runtime to parse

## Testing with Crystal Copilot

1. **Upload any of these files** through the Streamlit interface
2. **View the mock metadata** generated by our parser
3. **Test field lineage** analysis features
4. **Verify error handling** and validation

## Getting Real .rpt Files

For testing with actual Crystal Reports files, you can:

1. **Create reports** in Crystal Reports Designer
2. **Export sample reports** from existing systems
3. **Download samples** from SAP/BusinessObjects community
4. **Use demo files** from Crystal Reports installation

## Mock Data Generated

When uploaded, these files will generate realistic metadata including:
- Report information (name, version, creation date)
- Section structure (headers, details, footers)
- Data source connections
- Field mappings and lineage
- Formula definitions
- Visual element descriptions

This allows you to test the full Crystal Copilot workflow without needing actual Crystal Reports infrastructure.
